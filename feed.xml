I have been pricing some more new books and getting old books out of the shelfs. I furthermore also put some new books onto the shelfs within the correct category alphabetically. In the afternoon there was a book presentation in the event hall, some things needed to be prepared, so I helped with placing chairs and arrange glasses.

I did the things I needed to do: put my bag and jacket in the canteen. At first I didn't have a lot to do because Simone (the store manager) was working at the counter, however I could put prices on some bookmarkers. When Simone came back I got some assignments which I could fulfil, I had to scan and price some more boxes with new books, place certain stickers on books and clean the displays on the second floor. Furthermore I took a short break, I interviewed one of the employees and finally updated the magazine supply. Every now and then I tried to make a picture for my report. I rounded off my day at around 15:45.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hidde Agterberg</name></author><summary type="html">It all started at 11 o'clock in the morning again, when I arrived at the American Book Center.

When I arrived at the store, I put my bag and jacket upstairs away in the canteen, then I also met some new staff. The first thing I had to do was putting an IKEA lamp together, which did not take a long time. After that I had to get the new magazines and newspaper out of the packaging and stick the price onto them (translated from pounds to euros), some items that were reserved needed to be put aside and they had to be placed in the archive. My next assignment was to clear one of the display tables, collect certain 2018 calendars and place them in a way that the biggest piles would be in the middle. It was already getting late and I still didn't have a break , so I took a break and had lunch. To finish off the work I was asked to get new books out of the stacked boxes In the back of the store, scan the book into the computer, and stick the price card on it. After a few of these boxes, I could stop working and I was permitted to go home. I took the tram to our hotel, had something to eat and my mother then drove me to the beach to surf.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hidde Agterberg</name></author><summary type="html">Today I started at eleven o'clock in the morning, I took the tram to downtown The Hague and walked to the shop.
