When I arrived at the store, I put my bag and jacket upstairs away in the canteen, then I also met some new staff. The first thing I had to do was putting an IKEA lamp together, which did not take a long time. After that I had to get the new magazines and newspaper out of the packaging and stick the price onto them (translated from pounds to euros), some items that were reserved needed to be put aside and they had to be placed in the archive. My next assignment was to clear one of the display tables, collect certain 2018 calendars and place them in a way that the biggest piles would be in the middle. It was already getting late and I still didn't have a break , so I took a break and had lunch. To finish off the work I was asked to get new books out of the stacked boxes In the back of the store, scan the book into the computer, and stick the price card on it. After a few of these boxes, I could stop working and I was permitted to go home. I took the tram to our hotel, had something to eat and my mother then drove me to the beach to surf.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hidde Agterberg</name></author><summary type="html">Today I started at eleven o'clock in the morning, I took the tram to downtown The Hague and walked to the shop.
